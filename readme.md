a fractal viewer i made in a couple of hours to widen my understanding of them

featuring a special duck fractal i discovered by messing with the function (idk if its known)

right click to zoom in on a point, left click to log plane coordinates to console (and redraw),
if things get blurry, you can change the depth paramter in the dev console
`depth = value; // default is 100`
